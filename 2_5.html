        Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
    </h1>
<p>
    Outcome 1: Create structures and styles for a web page is achieved as evidenced by the product.
</p>

    <p>
        The site was created from nothing essentially using the new skills I gained from the 3 week course - a new directory was created then individual html files, they were linked together into a navigation structure and content was added to the pages then styled, appropriate visuals were incorporated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Outcome 2: Using website software tools to prepare content for sites is achieved as evidenced by the product.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The above outcome 1 was achieved using a range of software tools such as Google Docs to create content, Trello for project management, draw io to design a structure, Visual Studio Code for editing of html and css files and the terminal in Visual Studio Code was used to command git to use github for backup of the project and finally the project was published using github pages at <a href="https://mdrse.github.io/">https://mdrse.github.io/</a>
    </p>
    
   <p>
    I would submit that what was produced matches the specification for the exercise and is fit for the purpose outlined.
