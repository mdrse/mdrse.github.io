    <h2>
        About me
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Mr David R Southall ESQ. This page was created for Code Nation's Coding Course. I live in Blacon just outside of Chester. I have 5 cats. I'm single.
    </p>
    <h2>
        My background
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was born in 1971 which at the time of writing makes me 48. I was born Neuro-A-Typical(Autistic) but did not know until a few years ago. Being Autistic prior to diagnosis has caused a huge amount of problems in my life, for example I am a suicide survivor at 15, hence, the semicolon necklace, however, since diagnosis I have done a huge amount of research, had a great deal of help and I am continuing a path of personal growth. Autism has caused a number of deficits but I am discovering has gifted me a number of strengths also which I am exploring.
    </p>
    <h2>
        My interests in technology and coding
    </h2>
    <p>
        IT was my first love and I had a Commodore 64 at 15, justice which translated to law is my second small obsession and i have a minor interest in psychology as a doorway to understanding myself better.<br>
        <br>
        The earliest training I received was when I was around 18 in COBOL then C programming.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why Code Nation?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I started developing a business idea heart-is.co.uk Ltd, this was produced by developers but I’d like to re-write this from scratch in JavaScript to have a deep understanding of the project before moving it forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of training with Code Nation is to build on my existing IT skills with 2020 industry standard practices so I can add further options to consider, by doing both the 3 week and the 3 month course I would be able to consider if I wanted to work for an employer in the future or continue with my business idea. “Education creates options which creates freedom!”.
