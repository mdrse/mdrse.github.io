        Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What Skills?

    <p>
        Digital project managers make sure all elements of the project are moving along smoothly. This can include, creating and communicating a project plan, schedule, and budget. DPM may be in charge of assigning tasks and deadlines or it may be a looser structure.
        Scheduling frequent check-ins is important to keep on track. Clearing roadblocks might be a team effort to find a solution through stand-up meetings and research. The team may be hitting a brick wall(challenge) that may be difficult therefore escalating challenges when necessary might be vital.

        In general terms without being specific of any particular tool to complete a digital project you need to be able to:
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Communicate: Depending on the situation you may need to communicate with the customer and a team and create a record of what was communicated by whom and when.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Plan: Any project needs a method to keep track of what the end goal is, what tasks are needed to be done to reach that goal, who should produce those tasks, to keep track of the progress of the tasks and to keep track of completed tasks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Produce: Projects need a production environment even writing a letter requires paper and a pen and a writing surface, these minimum requirements could be described as the production environment and the skill(writing) and the person(writer) is required to complete the project.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Test: All projects should be tested by the producer and then independently to ensure the prototype fulfills the requirements of the project before considering the project completed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Document: Documentation might be required of the project build and documentation might be required of how to use the finished development - a user might need training or a user manual.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Publish: Projects usually have an audience in mind even cooking for yourself has an end user, yourself, you are the customer for the meal which you have laboured(performed tasks) to produce in the production environment of your kitchen, so by presenting the finished cooked meal to yourself you are publishing the fruits of your labour.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Archive: Projects may need archiving so the producers can return to the project in the future, taking the meal analogy further - if you came up with a better recipe for say “lemon chicken”, you might want to to document the steps you took so you can reproduce that product at a later date.
