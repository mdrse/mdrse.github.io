    I used a range of tools to complete the task and judged they were adequate to complete the task. I started with Google Docs: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/">https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/</a> ; this allows a user to write a document which autosaves as you create and also allows you to share as a link either editable by team members or just for viewing. Extremely useful for collaborating. Trello: <a href="https://trello.com/">https://trello.com/</a> is another useful collaboration tool allowing the user to define tasks as cards and assign them, however, Trello is also extremely good when working alone as a personal planner and task monitor.

    I did change my mind about inVision: <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">https://www.invisionapp.com/</a> ; inVision is essentially a electronic whiteboard but I found it too freehand for my tastes so I switched to draw io: <a href="https://www.draw.io/">https://www.draw.io/</a> draw io allows you to create a wireframe by dragging shapes onto the workspace and connecting with arrows so was much more suited to my needs. Visual Studio Code was fine for HTML and CSS: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>  ; Visual Studio Code also nicely integrates with <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> where I created a repository for backup: <a href="https://github.com/mdrse/codenationhtmldrs/tree/master/codenationhtmldrsday010">https://github.com/mdrse/codenationhtmldrs/tree/master/codenationhtmldrsday010</a>
I also added a bell & whistle by creating a short video in <a href="https://www.doodly.com/">https://www.doodly.com/</a>
