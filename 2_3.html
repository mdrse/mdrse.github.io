    If this was a real world situation I would not use the procedure I have detailed above, instead of Visual Studio Code I would use WordPress for this kind of personal website as WordPress is a rapid development environment, see: <a href="https://wordpress.com/">https://wordpress.com/</a>

        Essential WordPress removes the need for basic html editing by hand it is more akin to a word processor but for html files, therefore, saves a huge amount of time and is incredibly flexible to build very complex websites as it supports a plugin library of thousands of extensions to the basic package.

        I would host this type of personal site on IONOS Essential, see: <a href="https://www.ionos.co.uk/hosting/wordpress-hosting#packages">https://www.ionos.co.uk/hosting/wordpress-hosting#packages</a>
