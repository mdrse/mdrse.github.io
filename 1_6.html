        Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code version control.

            The first technology that should be used is a pencil and paper to roughly note out a specification and then transfer this specification to a document software such as Google Docs. an example of a procedure for a website is at:

            Slack for communication is excellent and a free resource there are various other products out in the market such as Skype but Slack has become the industry standard for communication with teams either working remotely or single space based.

            When planning I do feel usage should be made of prototyping methods such as a whiteboard and wireframe plan, however, software is freely available to accomplish these tasks and should be used an analogy is to do Maths you can use an abacus but it is better to use  a modern calculator. inVision is one example used(it is claimed by the company) by 5 million organisations and individuals.

            When using free resources Trello is excellent and allows the user to create a very flexible way of managing any project, if budgets are available then research should be done to see if better products are available but the default should always be Trello.

            Github is another free resource which has become the industry standard for versioning control by popularity and wide adoption by the community of builders.
