        <p>
            I have created a new Trello list “To Do Website(Sprint 2)”, however, there is no actual design as of yet so therefore until the design/wireframe there are currently no further tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/cmgz7F6b/d2418a45f846c21dd28b8fb8a3bd729a/unit-1">https://trello.com/invite/b/cmgz7F6b/d2418a45f846c21dd28b8fb8a3bd729a/unit-1</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I plan on first writing “user stories”, a user story is a feature that a user might want for example: “As a user I would like to have a contact form so I can fill in my name and email address and make a comment or ask a question.”
        </p>

        <p>
            See: <a href="https://stormotion.io/blog/how-to-write-a-good-user-story-with-examples-templates/">https://stormotion.io/blog/how-to-write-a-good-user-story-with-examples-templates/</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the “user stories” are written I plan to use those to write a specification for the website using a plan similar to the one available here: <a href="https://wemakewebsites.com/blog/how-to-write-a-website-specification/">https://wemakewebsites.com/blog/how-to-write-a-website-specification/</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I will then wireframe the design using inVision.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the spec & wireframe is ready I will transfer the specification into Trello cards which will be tasks to produce the specification.
        </p>

        <p>
            I plan on using Github for backup archiving and version control in conjunction with WordPress to produce and publish the website.
        </p>

        <p>
            I will call upon the other members of the Code Nation course for testing and suggestions improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any documentation required will be in Google Docs.
        </p>

            As well as the submitted HTML the final product will be available to view at <a href="https://david-r-southall.me/">https://david-r-southall.me/</a>
