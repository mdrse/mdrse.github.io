        Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
    </h1>
    <p>
        The basics are html, css and image files such as jpg files, however, a better question is what file type cannot be used on modern websites, the modern web browser such as Chrome from Google can handle a huge amount of file types and with plug ins to the web browser many more.
