        Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h1>
    <p>
        As this project was quite simple it was a case of just self testing that each interaction worked as expected e.g. does the site load on a range of common web browsers? Does each link work as expected? Then asking a second person to do the same. If this was a more significant product then a more formal testing plan would be written and implemented, an example of such a plan can be seen at: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-create-your-own-front-end-website-testing-plan/">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-create-your-own-front-end-website-testing-plan/</a>"
