        I cannot see any drawbacks for myself from using the set of tools that I did because I knew how to use them effectively. I would imagine there potentially could be a drawback if the person has no knowledge of tools such as these and would need to be on-boarded into them which would slow a project while that particular user was brought up to speed. I think when putting together a new team for a task using these tools initially evaluation of each person's level of knowledge of the tools would be essential and then making sure there is parity of ability in the team would be required. This would be accomplished via training on each tool prior to using the tool for the product build.
