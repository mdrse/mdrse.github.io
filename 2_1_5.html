        Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
    </h1>

<p>
    Cookies
    A cookie can be thought of as an internet user’s identification card, which tells a website when the user has returned. Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping cart.

    Distance Selling and Online Trading
    There are a number of rules that will apply if you are selling online. You must display information such as: your business name and contact details, a description of your goods or services, the price, including all taxes, the steps to place an order how a customer can pay delivery arrangements, costs and how long.

    Email Marketing
    Contrary to how it appears as you probably receive loads of spam emails, as I do, you are only allowed to send marketing emails to individual customers if they’ve given you permission. If customers have consented to receiving information from you in the past, ie opted in, you can send them information on other things.
</p>

    Opt out or Opt in?
    In the past website forms tended to be set up such that if you accepted the defaults you were assumed to agree to whatever was being asked (eg “Accept new product and marketing information.” or “Agree to information being passed to business partners”). So the boxes were ticked for you already by default and you.

    Data Protection
    Data Protection requires that you notify the Information Commissioner what you are going to use the personal data you collect for. The UK Government site is helpful should you want to investigate your Data Protection obligations. Out of this requirement comes the website Privacy Policy.

    Copyright
    Copyright gives the creator of certain types of material rights to control the use or commercial exploitation of that material. This includes material published on the internet. So you cannot use someone else’s text copy or photos or images on your website without their permission. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Minimum information to be provided on websites and emails
    Websites, whether involved in e-commerce or not, should provide at least: The name of the service provider. This might differ from the trading name and any such difference should be explained – e.g. “XYZ.com is the trading name of XYZ Enterprises Limited.”
