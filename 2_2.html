        The only one I had a problem with was inVision but I think that was more a personal taste issue - I prefer the drag and drop premade shapes style of draw io rather than freehand sketching. The rest were fine and suitable for the tasks at hand.

    Each one of the used applications worked well for the purpose it was used for, Google Docs is particularly nice as it saves as you type automatically and is cloud based for the document, being a fan of chromebooks I find the use of the Google Suite helpful generally anyway.

    Trello again is cloud based so once you have your account you can log in anywhere as long as you have Internet and a suitable device and browser. Draw io integrates nicely with Google Drive for saving files produced. Visual Studio Code is “OK” but there are better apps out there but considering it is free one cannot really complain.
