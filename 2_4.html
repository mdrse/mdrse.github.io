        I do intend to reuse the content I have written for my own personal website at <a href="https://david-r-southall.me/">https://david-r-southall.me/</a> so the more extensive wireframe details my ideas for the expanded site, see: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qqlh0zvT7z-AdGW1_ZccDHBxrlGl-Iqc/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qqlh0zvT7z-AdGW1_ZccDHBxrlGl-Iqc/view?usp=sharing</a>
