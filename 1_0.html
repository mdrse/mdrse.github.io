    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I was born in 1971 which at the time of writing makes me 48. I was born Neuro-A-Typical(Autistic) but did not know until a few years ago. Being Autistic prior to diagnosis has caused a huge amount of problems in my life, for example I am a suicide survivor at 15, hence, the semicolon necklace, however, since diagnosis I have done a huge amount of research, had a great deal of help and I am continuing a path of personal growth. Autism has caused a number of deficits but I am discovering has gifted me a number of strengths also which I am exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
        IT was my first love and I had a Commodore 64 at 15, justice which translated to law is my second small obsession and i have a minor interest in psychology as a doorway to understanding myself better. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The earliest training I received was when I was around 18 in COBOL then C programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        2001 I was an IT Manager for a car sales business, it was a very stressful job and the owner was a martinet, a close friend died and my brain did the equivalent of a blue screen of death, I then isolated myself in my fortress of solitude(my flat) and eat(self harmed) my way to 38 stone in weight or 241.311KG. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I had a two stage duodenal switch operation in 2009 & 2010, this has reduced my weight to its current level of around 20 stone or 127.006KG. I hope to eventually reach around 15 stone which is a normal weight for my height and build.
    </p>
    <p>
        The upsides are I can eat without putting on weight, it is impossible for me to become diabetic. The downsides are I have to obtain 100g of protein each day from my meals & I have to take a large number of supplements daily and when I do reach my goal weight I will need to have further surgeries on skin.

        2015 I was coming out of my depression and was thinking: “What do I want to do next?”. I did a GCSE Maths & English with a view to going on a 1 year access to higher education course in Law & Criminology, a family member in 2016 asked me to help them with a landlord and tenant issue which lasted till April 2018 so I never continued with that plan, I consider it on hold, I still hope to study law, as law is a love but the system of law is not. I got by helping the family member a peek behind the curtain at the system of law in England & Wales and gained some on the job training as I like to call it and I now have some skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used my newly gained law knowledge to navigate the benefits system for myself and now volunteer with Dial House in Chester where I write court submissions for lower tribunal to help people get their benefits back when the benefits have been unjustly removed, I also do this privately for people who approach me which I do not charge for only recoup expenses such as postage.

        I also due to my usage of these skills to help people was invited to join the Civil Justice Council’s 7th Annual Conference On Access To Justice For Those Without Means and I am a member of The Litigant In Person Network
    </p>
    <p>
        I am active in the Chester Labour Party and was a paper candidate for Tarpoley at the last local election after which I was elected as “Disability Officer” on Chester Constituency Labour Party’s Executive Committee.

    <p>
        2018 I was invited to be a “Community Inspirer”(CI) on the 2nd West Cheshire Poverty Truth Commission, there are 15 CIs out of a population of around 300,000 in West Cheshire so it is a responsibility and an honour to be asked and I take the role very seriously. I choose the sub-group “Housing & Homelessness Trap” and this is what I hope our team will accomplish by March 2021:

        Why did I join the Code Nation Coding Course?
    </p>
    <p>
        During the two years I was helping my family member I also started developing a business idea heart-is.co.uk Ltd, this was produced by developers but I’d like to re-write this from scratch in JavaScript to have a deep understanding of the project before moving it forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of training with Code Nation is to build on my existing IT skills with 2020 industry standard practices so I can add further options to consider, by doing both the 3 week and the 3 month course I would be able to consider if I wanted to work for an employer in the future or continue with my business idea. “Education creates options which creates freedom!”.
