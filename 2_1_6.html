        Disability Accessibility
        The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 make it illegal for web sites to discriminate against a disabled person. Traditional web design techniques create web sites that do actively discriminate against disabled persons by making it harder for them to use the web site than it needs to be.

    <p>
        For those with visual impairments, learning difficulties, hearing loss and more, there are dozens of unique challenges waiting behind every URL. But building a disability-friendly site is a lot simpler than you might think.
    </p>
    <p>
        People with disabilities often use assistive technologies to access websites. A website that is accessible is designed to function properly with assistive technologies so that the information and functionality that is fundamental to the website is made accessible to every visitor.

        In some cases, such as in the case of color blindness, no assistive technologies are used. Instead, websites that are accessible to these visitors consider these issues as they design their website, and make proper use of visual elements.

        In short, according to the W3C: “web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web” (source) regardless of the disability. Reaching that level of access is the goal of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, which is the current applicable standard from the W3C.
